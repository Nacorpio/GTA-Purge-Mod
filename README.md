# GTA V: The Purge
GTA V: The Purge is a modification for Grand Theft Auto V, which allows you to play like you were in the movie "The Purge".
The Purge is one night annually, where every crime becomes legal - even murder. This means that people team up and do it together.
They do it to make the United States a better nation, to get rid of the poor and lower the crime rate. This mod is exactly what the
movie is - The Purge.
